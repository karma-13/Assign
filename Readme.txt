This is a Python application that is designed to extract tweets from a given keyword "#greenhydrogen".
It is also used to extract news info from google rss news feed about green hydrogen.




TO RUN :
Please use the "print" statements provided to check the functionality of each aspect of the program.
For the API part kindly copy the local host and the add "/Result" to view.
The 'csv' file is attached.


DIFFICULTIES FACED:
1. The function created for getting the news information gets only 100 entrie/blogs, so after putting it in data frame and
    then for merging it with the twitter function , the size of the data frames must be equal so instead of getting entries
    from 1st Feb there are current 100 news blogs and tweets.

2. In the sentiment analysis part the hugging interface model used was not compatible, so that part was completely omitted.
    But later on by further research and finding the correct model for this task sentiment analysis can be done.




This assignment has helped me gain understanding and make improvements regarding this field and it was a fun challenge to do.
